		<h3>Enjoy sipping flower juice</h3>
		<p>Have you ever watched a butterfly or hummingbird sip nectar from a flower? 
		You, too, can enjoy sipping flower juice by drinking floral teas. Classic black, 
		green, and white teas are made from the leaves of the tea plant Camellia sinensis 
		and contain caffeine. Herbal teas or tisanes, on the other hand, are made from a 
		wide variety of plant materials and spices and do not contain caffeine or actual 
		tea leaves from the tea plant. In addition to having unique flavors, herbal teas 
		are often packed with health benefits. Many herb leaves are commonly used to make 
		popular teas, but today, I would like to present some of the most popular teas made from flowers.</p>

		<h3>How to Make Floral Teas</h3>
		<p>You can find all kinds of floral teas in stores and online. They may be sold as 
		flower heads, chopped flowers, dried cakes, or in tea bags. However, if you have a 
		garden, why not try making your own? I love making my own teas and giving them as gifts. 
		Chamomile, roses, hibiscus, and linden are just a few types of flowers that are good for 
		making tea. Actually, any edible flower can be used to make a tea, but they may not all taste good!</p>
		<p>To make your own floral tea, use only healthy flowers that are free of chemical 
		fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides. You can use fresh or dried flowers for tea. 
		Most people who make homemade tea preferred dried flowers because they are easier to 
		store. If using fresh flowers, be sure to rinse them first. If drying the flowers, tie 
		flower stems and hang them upside-down in bunches in a well-ventilated, warm, dark place 
		such as an attic. You can also spread them on a screen to dry or dry them in the oven. 
		Keep the dried flowers in an airtight, labeled jar and store in a dark place; they will keep up to a year.</p>
		<p>It is easy to make a tea whether using dried or fresh flowers. Use one tablespoon 
		of fresh flowers or one teaspoon of dried flowers steeped in one cup of boiling water. 
		You can use a tea bag or tea ball or just strain the tea with a cloth. Usually, the 
		steeping time is three to ten minutes; the longer it brews, the stronger it will be.</p>
